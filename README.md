# Metrology Assurance Suite

Metrology Assurance Suite is a Go HTTP service for bounded laboratory
measurement assurance work. It registers devices, confirms each device on site
before it enters service, opens verification cases only for commissioned
devices, records measurements, handles failed tolerance decisions, and seals
traceable evidence records.

## Run

```bash
go run ./cmd/metrology-service --addr 127.0.0.1:18121
```

The service listens on `127.0.0.1:18121` by default.

## Build And Verify

```bash
go build ./...
go run ./cmd/workflowcheck --workflow register-device
go run ./cmd/workflowcheck --workflow commission-device
go run ./cmd/workflowcheck --workflow open-verification-case
go run ./cmd/workflowcheck --workflow record-measurement
go run ./cmd/workflowcheck --workflow reopen-verification-case
go run ./cmd/workflowcheck --workflow seal-verification
```

The workflow runner starts a fresh in-process HTTP service and exercises the
public API. It is a production smoke command, not a unit test.

Tests are intentionally deferred for this initialization baseline. The later
engineering-task stage will add the unit and integration test suite and replace
or extend these smoke checks with red/green verification tests.

## API

- `GET /healthz`
- `POST /devices`
- `GET /devices/{id}`
- `POST /devices/{id}/confirmations`
- `GET /devices/{id}/confirmations`
- `POST /cases`
- `GET /cases/{id}`
- `POST /cases/{id}/measurements`
- `POST /cases/{id}/reopen`
- `POST /cases/{id}/seal`
- `GET /cases/{id}/events`

## Device Lifecycle

A device is registered as `pending_commissioning`. A responsible party confirms
the install location, foundation state, accountable owner, and evidence basis
via `POST /devices/{id}/confirmations`; that one atomic commit moves the device
to `active` and records the immutable confirmation. Only `active` devices can
open cases. Failed or repeated confirmations commit nothing, and confirmation
history stays traceable after the device is enabled or later retired. The case
view embeds the same device lifecycle fact.

## Layout

- `cmd/metrology-service`: executable HTTP server.
- `cmd/workflowcheck`: bounded workflow verification commands.
- `internal/httpapi`: route and JSON boundary.
- `internal/assurance`: workflow orchestration.
- `internal/domain`: state rules and invariants.
- `internal/repository`: copy-on-write in-memory persistence.
- `internal/contracts`: API request and response models.
- `internal/bootstrap`: concrete dependency wiring.

## Inputs And Outputs

Inputs are JSON HTTP requests. Outputs are JSON response envelopes with either a
resource view or a stable error object:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "state_conflict",
    "message": "case is not awaiting measurement"
  }
}
```

The service has no environment variables and no external dependencies.
